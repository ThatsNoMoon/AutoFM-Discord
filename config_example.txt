# You must rename this file to config.txt to start AutoFM

# Input your bot's token here (you cannot remove this line):

# This is the default prefix (you can safely remove this line):
prefix:fm!

# ID of the bot owner, this user will be able to always use all bot commands, including shutdown and restart
# This line is not required, but is highly recommended. Shutting down the bot with a method other than
# the shutdown command is not recommended, and may have side-effects
# You can have multiple owner ID lines to add multiple owners, but be careful.
owner ID:your id here

# Provide a stream URL to use streaming mode (remove # to use a livestream, this is an example URL):
# If you don't include this line or a playlist line, your playlist.txt must not be empty
# stream:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=some video id here

# Provide a playlist URL to use a YouTube playlist (remove # to use a playlist, this is an example URL):
# If you don't include this line or a stream line your playlist.txt must not be empty
# You can add multiple playlist lines to add multiple YouTube playlists to AutoFM's playlist
# playlist:https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=playlist id here

# Channels to join automatically (remove # to use auto-join channels)
# (These are example channel IDs, input your own channel IDs):

# Roles that can use bot commands regardless of how many users are using the bot already 
# (Remove # to use DJ roles, these are examples, don't use the provided IDs)
#
# Example: everyone is a DJ
# (don't include DJ roles line)
#
# Example: nobody is a DJ
# DJ roles:
#
# Example: 2 roles are DJ roles

# Time to wait before leaving a voice channel when there are no other users, in this format:
# 5000 for 5000 milliseconds (5 seconds)
# 10s for 10 seconds
# 15m for 15 minutes
# 2h for 2 hours
# (Remove # to use voice timeout)
# voice timeout:30m

# Whether or not to rejoin a channel when somebody joins it if the timeout was exceeded
# This option does nothing if a voice timeout is not set
# For example, if Bob leaves the #music channel he was in and AutoFM is now lonely and leaves after 15 minutes...
# ...if this option is on, AutoFM will rejoin the #music channel if anyone joins the #music channel later
# Should be yes or no
# (Remove # to rejoin after timeout)
# rejoin after timeout:yes
