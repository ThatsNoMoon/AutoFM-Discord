# âš  AutoFM is not being maintained!
I'm not interested in maintaining AutoFM anymore, and have not been in a while. I don't use Discord music bots anymore, but I'm sure there's an acceptable replacement somewhere out there.


AutoFM, a work in progress discord bot for selfhosters to continually play music from a playlist file, a YouTube playlist, or a YouTube livestream.
AutoFM has easy to use configuration, and simple commands. Perfect for times when you just want to listen to some music, and you don't want to try to remember to queue songs, or what songs you want to add.
